Fast forward a WHOLE bunch of years, and I have decided to rekindle that love of watercolor painting. My focus has been on capturing the beauty and color found in nature. I feel that watercolor allows me to really focus on the color found in various plants and objects instead of just looking at the object as a whole.<!--more-->

I picked up a new set of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SHINHAN-Professional-Watercolor-Paint-7-5ml/dp/B00E6KGIBK" target="_blank" rel="noopener">professional quality watercolor paints</a> and so far love the color options that this set provides. I've also been trying out a new (to me) watercolor paper made by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Canson-Watercolor-30-Sheet-12-Inch-X-Large/dp/B01N6YX2DD/ref=sr_1_3?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIlbuGwLr94QIVk7fACh2XqwQmEAAYASAAEgKX4_D_BwE&hvadid=174226925659&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9019429&hvnetw=g&hvpos=1t1&hvqmt=e&hvrand=12909978145253841089&hvtargid=kwd-6102132039&hydadcr=24631_9648902&keywords=canson+watercolor+paper&qid=1556821096&s=gateway&sr=8-3">Canson</a>, which I definitely recommend for those just starting out. It holds the color well, and the cold press paper has seemed to work the way I expected. A few more papers that are on my list to try out are the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Strathmore-140-208-Ready-Cut-Sheets/dp/B004WFUES2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Strathmore</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008N0BC2Y/ref=ox_sc_saved_title_9?smid=AT4IKN8NTJ8DZ&psc=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arches</a>. I've used Arches cold press paper in large sheets in the past, as this was what I used in my college painting courses. I loved the smoothness and precise color control the paper allowed.
