At Evolved Perception, my goal is to not only help you create beautiful, functioning websites, but also to make them fast, reliable, and most importantly — accessible by all. I'll work to achieve this by helping you to make sure your site meets the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), passes W3C requirements, and create a style guide for you so that you can ensure a consistent web experience no matter who on your team is working on developing or designing for your site. An accessible, responsive, user friendly site is the end goal, and I look forward to working with you all to make that possible.

## Style Guides
### Why do you need a style guide anyway?
A style guide helps to ensure everyone on your team uses the same consistent set of brand elements. When there are multiple designers and developers working on the same brand, a style guide is a great resource to ensure that future and third-party production follow brand guidelines. Style guides can make it easier for everyone on the development team to reuse elements as well.
			
### What is defined in a style guide?
The following are examples of things that may be included in a style guide:

<ul class="showList">
<li>Brand Message</li>
<li>Define Typography</li>
<li>Color Palette</li>
<li>Voice</li>
<li>Iconography</li>
<li>Imagery</li>
<li>Forms</li>
<li>Buttons</li>
<li>Spacing</li>
<li>FAQ and Usage Examples</li>
</ul>
    
## Interactive Prototypes
Interactive prototypes are created using Adobe XD, which provides the ability to mock-up your website so you can interact with it – and make updates – quickly and efficiently before any coding is actually done. It allows you to get a feel for how your website will look and function on various devices as well.

### Step One: Research & Planning
Whether you have an existing website or are just starting out, we’ll get together and discuss your goals, define work flows, and determine your target audience.
		
### Step Two: Wireframes
I’ll create a few layout options for you to review and make revisions to. Once a layout is determined, the prototyping step can begin, which is where you’ll really start to see your website come together!				
		
### Step Three: UI/UX Design / Prototyping
The look and feel of the site. I’ll work on the branding and appearance of the site to establish a consistent brand message throughout. If desired, a style guide can be created to ensure future development follows the same standards. I’ll develop interactive prototypes so you can see your website in action, but still allow for changes to be made.
			
### Step Four: Front End Development
Once a final design and website content are decided, I’ll work off of the previous interactive mock-ups to build your website. If you have a current website that needs to be updated, I can do that! Otherwise, I can integrate the design we’ve decided on into WordPress CMS so that you can quickly and easily update your content as you need to in the future. If a basic site is all you are looking for, I can help you get set up using Squarespace or Wix as well!

## Accessibility
An accessible website allows people with disabilities the opportunity to interact with your business. This includes those with visual, auditory and speech issues. By working to provide the best experience for them as well we can try to remove some of the barriers that make it difficult for them to use the web. If a user can’t access a site, they’ll find one that they can – so let's work together to make your site the one that is easily accessible by all users.

### What can we do to make the web accessible?


### Step One: Evaluate the existing site
If you have an existing website, I’ll use various tools to help evaluate where your site is currently at. These tools are also very helpful to use throughout the development process to identify chances to improve the site early on.
			
### Step Two: Results from evaluation
I’ll include the URL(s) tested when your site was reviewed, as well as links to find more information on how you can improve and meet the requirements necessary.
